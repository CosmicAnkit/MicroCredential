## MicroCredential: A Decentralized Platform for Credential Management

![Micro-Credential](./image.png)

**Overview:**

This project provides a decentralized platform for issuing, transferring, and verifying micro-credentials on the Ethereum blockchain. It leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency, security, and immutability.

**Features:**

- **Credential Issuance:** Authorized entities can issue credentials with specific details, including:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Issuer
    - Owner
- **Credential Transfer:** Owners can transfer their credentials to other addresses.
- **Credential Verification:** Anyone can verify the authenticity and ownership of a credential.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Credentials are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring their immutability and transparency.
- **Security:** The platform utilizes blockchain technology to provide enhanced security and prevent tampering.

**Project Structure:**

- `contracts/MicroCredential.sol`: The Solidity smart contract for managing micro-credentials.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code for interacting with the smart contract.
- `README.md`: This file (you're currently reading it).
- `package.json`: Manages project dependencies.
- `truffle-config.js`: (Optional) Configuration for Truffle development framework.

**Deployment:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/microcredential.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd microcredential
   npm install
   ```
3. **Compile and Deploy:**
   - Use Truffle or a similar tool to compile your smart contract and deploy it to your desired Ethereum network.
   - Replace the placeholder `0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4` in your frontend code with the actual deployed contract address.
4. 


**Usage:**

- **Connect Wallet:** Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the frontend.
- **Issue Credential:** Fill in the required details and click the "Issue Credential" button.
- **Transfer Credential:** Select a credential and enter the recipient's address to transfer ownership.
- **Verify Credential:** Enter a credential ID to verify its authenticity and ownership.
